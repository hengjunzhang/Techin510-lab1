# Rowan's Personal Web Page

## Project Overview
This project is a personal web page created using Streamlit, showcasing my bio, skills, projects, and ways to connect with me. The goal was to learn how to use Streamlit for web development and to create a personal platform for professional visibility.

## Features
- Bio Section: A brief introduction about myself.
- Skills Section: A list of my technical skills.
- Projects Section: Highlights of some projects I've worked on.
- Connect Section: Links to my social media and professional profiles.

## Learnings
- Learned the basics of Streamlit, including setting up and running Streamlit apps.
- Gained experience in using different Streamlit components to create various sections of a web page.
- Understood the importance of making code modular for better readability and maintenance.

## Reflections
- Initially struggled with making the code modular but found that defining separate functions for each section of the web page helped in organizing the code better.
- Realized that incorporating more Streamlit components could enhance the interactivity and user engagement of the web page.
- Found that regular practice and experimenting with different Streamlit components significantly improved my understanding and skill.

## Questions
- What are some best practices for structuring Streamlit apps for scalability and maintainability?
- How can I effectively use Streamlit's layout options to create a more visually appealing web page?
- Are there advanced Streamlit components or techniques that could further enhance the functionality of my personal web page?

## Code Improvements
- **Refinement in Code Readability and Style:** Ensured consistent naming conventions and added comments to make the code easier to understand.
- **Modularity:** Refactored the code by creating separate functions for each web page section, improving code organization and readability.
- **Use of Streamlit Components:** Incorporated additional Streamlit components like `st.sidebar` for navigation and `st.expander` for collapsible sections, utilizing concepts taught in class.

## Future Enhancements
- Plan to explore and integrate advanced Streamlit features like custom themes and interactive widgets.
- Interested in adding a blog section where I can share articles and tutorials.
- Considering the integration of a contact form for direct messaging.
